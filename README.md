# Miniature Prototype for Organic Waste-Based Compressed Biogas Production and Purification

## Project Overview

This final year engineering project focuses on developing a miniature prototype designed for the production, purification, and compression of biogas derived from organic waste. The project aims to provide a sustainable energy solution by utilizing anaerobic digestion for biogas generation, followed by purification to remove impurities and compression into cylinders for convenient storage and transport.
