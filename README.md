# Compressed-Biogas-Prototype
This final year engineering project focuses on developing a miniature prototype for purifying and compressing biogas from organic waste. It involves anaerobic digestion, biogas purification to remove impurities, and compression into cylinders for efficient storage and transport, promoting clean energy from organic waste.
